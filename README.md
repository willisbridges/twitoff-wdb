# twitoff-wdb

The purpose of this was to create a guided project that builds a web application where a user could input a tweet, two possible "tweeters" and the web applicaiton would return which tweeter more likely tweeted it. 

However, theres still some issues with getting it running. 

Will revisit this later.
